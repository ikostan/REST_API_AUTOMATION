# cars-api

A sample REST application to help testers learn to write API automation 

## What is REST
REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous [dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm).

Like any other architectural style, REST also does have itâ€™s own [6 guiding constraints](https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/) which must be satisfied if an interface needs to be referred as RESTful. These principles are listed below.
